I am a [Hakka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakka_people) born PhD student at [University of Maryland, Baltimore County](https://www.umbc.edu/). The main focus of my research is on designing machine learning algorithms that have theoretical performance guarantees and social consciousness. Read about my [research](/projects). During my PhD, I also spent time at [L3S Research Center](https://www.l3s.de/de), [University of Milano-Bicocca](https://www.unimib.it/), [King Abdullah University of Science and Technology](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en), and [Télécom Paris](https://dig.telecom-paristech.fr/blog/). I had four Stendhal syndrome years in Beijing before started my study abroad in Newfoundland, where June snowed (not anymore due to global warming). 

Outside of research, I enjoy watching and playing all kinds of sports especially football. I had my life experience at [Kaliningrad Stadium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaliningrad_Stadium) cheering 2018 World Cup Russia. I run my first Marathon at Virginia Beach credit to [November Project](https://november-project.com/baltimore-md/). Also, I believe Manchester is red.
