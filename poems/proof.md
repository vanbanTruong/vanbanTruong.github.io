### proof


Take epsilon of me and  
epsilon of you  


in March there is an  
epsilon of snow  
that descends  
like teeth  
sinking into tori  
but  
it is warm  
in the interior  


an afternoon I spend  
tracing your convexity  
but complexity  
lingers between us  
and  
the density  
of rationality  


gave  


given an epsilon  
of me  


the quiet of your breath exists  
there exists
