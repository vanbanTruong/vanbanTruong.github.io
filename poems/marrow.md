### marrow

Huddled around one end of the bar top we  
side-eyed our neighbors, swallowing our salivas when  
the server swooped in with the  
Roasted bone marrow  
 

A monstrous thing, like dinosaur bone  
but barely enough for three hungry goons  
We feed, we dig our spoons into the springy fat of dead pig  
Spread savagely onto toast  
 

At my parentâ€™s dinner table there was always marrow  
from the pig bones in the pig bone soup a weekly offering  
to the hunger gods  
will be pleased  

<!---
all the globs of pig bone on my plate  
the springiness the braininess the fat?  
<i>suck it all suck it all </i>
 

some mornings when I wake up  
feeling tiredness  
in my bones I remember  
in my bones there is marrow  


<i>and it will make you strong </i>so strong I  
dug deep with my baby chopstick and sucked for dear  
marrow
