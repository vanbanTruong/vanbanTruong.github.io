### Epilogue

there is a part of me that is not  
quite myself, it is a grain of nothing  
in the tip of my big toe or the back of my tongue  
or a corner or the heart of my heart  
one day as I was lying flat on my bed, the nothing  
danced though my tingling fingers  
and birthed itself beside me  
I listened  
to the breath of empty space, heavy  
and desirous, quivering with lust  
as a vacuum lusts  
for flakes of skin or dust  
so I set aside sleep,  
and surrendered myself,   
head first, to its shadowy lip,  
nail by nail, hair by hair, the emptiness  
consumes the living bits of me, smoothing over  
the stiff parts, like jaw, like neck,  
like spine bending over hips,  
and grows  
into a hungry, breathing thing  
whose breath is my breath,  
whose things are pieces of  
my anything
